# Beacon Object File (BOF)

This subproject contains a template to create new BOFs.
Furthermore it also contains useful BOFs for various phases for Red-Teaming projects. 

Inspired from trustedsec's repository [CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF](https://github.com/trustedsec/CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF).
